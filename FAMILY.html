		<p align="justify">  I canâ€™t imagine living my life without family by my side. Family is very important and valuable to me and 
				is something that should not be underestimated. Without my family, most of my life and culture would be lost. My father name is Zakaria. My mother name 
				is Jannatun Naimah Binti Che Mat Duzki. I have five siblings and i'm the third.</p>
				<p align="justify"><i><b>I know that I can always rely on someone to help me feel better. 
                 In fact, I think this is probably the most important thing my family has taught me; families are made up of people you can 
                 trust and who you can trust. Too many times today, we read in papers about families where parents abuse their children,
                 verbally and physically. What these parents do not realize is that they are starting or getting involved in a circle 
                 of hatred in the family. When parents abuse their children, they tell their children that this is how they their children,
                 and this is what their children learn. I was lucky, I learned differently, because my family cared about me, and I cared about them.</p>
