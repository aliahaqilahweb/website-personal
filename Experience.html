 <h2> Working Experience</h2>
 <p>I have a lot of experience in this life. One of the most memorable experiences of my life was working experience.<br/>
 I started working at the age of 12 at a restaurant in Selangor as a waiter. This is facebook of place that i working<br/> 
 <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Restoran-Raizann-110237137102505/" target="_blank">Restoran Raizann </a><br/>
 The restaurant is owned by my stepbrother. My family is not rich people and I think I need to help my family. When my<br/>
 father died, my mother struggled to raise us siblings. So, every time the year-end holiday I would work at the restaurant.<br/>
 The wages I get I will use to buy school supplies and also pay school fees.Through this, I was able to reduce my motherâ€™s <br/>
 burden. My mother always gave me advice and the words were always engraved in my heart. To this day, I still work if I have<br/>
 opportunities such as semester breaks. The words are:<br/></p>

 
 
<p><i><b> If life makes you cry. Remember, there are thousands<br/>
 of wonderful memories that make us smile.</i></b></p>

 <p> 
 I have a lot of experience while working there. Among them,I was able to meet various people because of them <br/> 
 and among them I made it as a lesson to me.One of them I often encounter customers who are kind of impatient<br/> 
 waiting for their turn. Some,of them also like to humiliate employees like me. Whenever my ,patienceis challenged<br/> 
 my sister will say that the customer is always right. So I can only be patient with them.This happens often and I<br/>
 take the lesson that we should not humiliate others if we do not know what is happening behind it.<br/></p>
 

 <p>Besides, in addition to my bitter experience, there was also a sweet experience. Among them,is that many customers <br/> 
 like to give alms. For example, they often pay for other customers food without the customer realizing it. This shows<br/> 
 that they are very kind and also generous. The experience I have here is that we must always be kind to others.In addition,<br/> 
 through this, work I can gain experience in overcoming various customer behaviors whether good or bad. Even so,by working<br/> 
 I get invaluable satisfaction besides I can help my mother.<br/> </p>
